Self-created/Group-Created/Class-Created Projects

This project involves using a simple user friendly UI to create accounts saved on txt file.
Users are then able to create user names and passwords to be saved on a txt file.
Run the program and create a new account with the sign-up button, then log-in accordingly
Test the program and create some user names and passwords to be saved, log out and sign back
in to see data was saved.


This file includes some txt files for you test, but it'll be easier to just make new
accounts and passwords yourself.

Thank you for testing! :)
